# landingpage

In this project, I will recreate this landing page (https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png) using nothing more than an image of the desired outcome and some information about font styles and colors (https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png).

I am not able to use developer tools to give me information about the design. Instead, I will replicate the elements to the best of my ability using HTML and CSS. To arrange the elements on the page, I'll be using Flexbox.
